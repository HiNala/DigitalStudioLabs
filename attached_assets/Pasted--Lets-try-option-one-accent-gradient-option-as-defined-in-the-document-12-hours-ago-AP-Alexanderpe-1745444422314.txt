I'll analyze the provided document to understand what you're building and propose a plan accordingly.

Based on the document, it appears you're building a premium website for Digital Studio Labs, a digital solutions provider specializing in custom web development, AI implementation, and related services. The website needs to establish credibility, generate leads, showcase capabilities, build trust, and support the company's Go-to-Market strategy.

Let me propose an MVP plan for this project:

Create a modern and visually appealing website for Digital Studio Labs

How does the Digital Studio Labs website look? I've implemented the premium design with the dark color scheme, gradient accents, and responsive layout as specified in the design doc. Can you navigate through the different pages (Home, Services, Portfolio, Process, About, Pricing, Contact)? Does the overall design convey the premium feel that was requested? Are there any specific sections or features you'd like improved?

✓ Created responsive dark-themed design with gradient accents
✓ Implemented all requested pages with appropriate sections
✓ Added interactive elements like hover effects and animations
✓ Built contact form with validation
✓ Integrated services, portfolio and pricing data

I'll install the Splite component from the shadcn community and implement it in our hero section. Let me get started right away.


Executed npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/serafimcloud/splite"
The command seems to have been installing the component but it timed out. Let me try an alternative approach by manually creating the Splite component. I'll examine the community component and build it ourselves.


Created client/src/components/ui/splite.tsx
Now, let's view the current HeroSection to understand what we need to modify:


Opened client/src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx
Now, let's modify the HeroSection to use our new Splite component:

I'll implement a SplineScene component and integrate it into our hero section with the Spotlight effect. Let's create these components one by one.

First, let's create the Spotlight component:


Created client/src/components/ui/spotlight.tsx
Now, let's create the SplineScene component to integrate with Spline:


Created client/src/components/ui/spline.tsx
Now, let's create the SplineSceneBasic component that will be used in the hero section:

I'm analyzing the current progress and status of the project...

Looking at my recent actions:
✓ Attempted to install shadcn component from custom URL
✓ Created ui/splite.tsx component but encountered ref handling issues
✓ Created alternative splite-simple.tsx component
✓ Started implementing SplineScene component for hero section
→ Creating supporting components (Spotlight, Card)

I'm working on implementing the new hero section with the 3D SplineScene component as requested. I need to complete the implementation of the SplineScene, Spotlight and Card components, then integrate them properly into the hero section.

I'll make the entire landing page more cohesive with a consistent black background and extend the spotlight effect throughout the website. Let's do this in a few steps:

Step 1: First, let's add the black background color to the main layout in App.tsx:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Let's create a SpotlightLayout component that we can reuse across all sections:


Created client/src/components/layout/SpotlightLayout.tsx
Now, let's update the HomePage component to use our SpotlightLayout for all sections:

Now let's make sure all the section components have a consistent dark background by updating the ServicesSection (we'll remove any background specifications since they will now be managed by the SpotlightLayout component):


Edited client/src/components/home/ServicesSection.tsx
Now let's enhance our IndustrySection to make it more consistent with the new dark theme and spotlight effects:


Opened client/src/components/home/IndustrySection.tsx
Let's update the IndustrySection with animations and remove the background specification:

Let's update the Header to make the mobile menu background consistent with our theme:

Looking at the updates I've made recently:
✓ Created SpotlightLayout component
✓ Applied SpotlightLayout across all sections
✓ Enhanced ServicesSection with improved animations
✓ Updated IndustrySection with Framer Motion animations
✓ Adjusted Header and Footer to match dark theme

I see the app has restarted successfully. Let's continue our work to make the website more cohesive with the dark background and spotlight effects.

Let's enhance the SplineHero component to seamlessly integrate with our new SpotlightLayout:


Opened client/src/components/home/SplineHero.tsx
I see what you mean - there are hard lines between sections. Let's fix this by applying the SpotlightLayout to the entire page instead of wrapping individual sections. This will create a smooth, continuous effect from top to bottom.

Here's the plan:

First, update the HomePage component to use a single SpotlightLayout for the entire main content
Remove the individual SpotlightLayout wrappers from each section
Ensure the SplineHero integrates seamlessly with the new layout
Let's start with updating the HomePage:


Edited client/src/pages/HomePage.tsx
Now, let's update the SplineHero component to better integrate with our new seamless layout:


Edited client/src/components/home/SplineHero.tsx
Now let's update the SpotlightLayout component to make it work better as a full-page wrapper:

✓ Implemented throttling for section detection to reduce unnecessary calculations
✓ Used requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations independent of browser refresh rate
✓ Added multiple layers with different follow speeds for a more dynamic effect

The cursor spotlight should now follow your mouse much more smoothly without any lag or stuttering. How does it look and feel now? Is the movement smooth and responsive?

Edited client/src/pages/PricingPage.tsx
Finally, let's check and update the ContactPage:


Opened client/src/pages/ContactPage.tsx
I've analyzed our current progress on the Digital Studio Labs website.

✓ Added animated gradient text effect with glow to headings
✓ Updated text styling on Home, About, and Services pages
✓ Updated Portfolio and Process pages with new text effects
✓ Updated Pricing page with animated gradient text
→ Checking Contact page to apply consistent styling
→ Verifying all pages are fully functional

I'm making good progress implementing the text effects across all pages. I'll continue to ensure all pages have consistent styling and are fully functional.

Now let's also update the header logo for consistency:


Edited client/src/components/layout/Header.tsx
Let's check if we have any other page that needs the new animated gradient text. Let's look at the not-found page:

Let's update the 404 page to match our website's style and make it more consistent with our design:

Now let's make sure our web app is fully functional by checking if our contact form will work. We need to make sure the backend routes and handling are properly set up for the contact form submission:


Opened server/routes.ts
Great! I can see that we already have the backend routes set up for the contact form and newsletter subscription. Now let's check and make sure our website looks good on the homepage:

Enhance page appearance with animated text effects and improve navigation
Screenshot
I've updated all pages with the new animated gradient text and glow effects. The text "Custom Digital Solutions" in the hero section now has a cool animated color shift effect with a subtle glow. I've also:

✓ Applied consistent text animation to headings across all pages
✓ Updated the header logo with the same animation effect
✓ Redesigned the 404 page to match the website's style
✓ Verified all navigation links are working
✓ Ensured backend routes for contact form submission are set up

How does the website look? Do you like the text animation effect? What would you like me to work on next?
