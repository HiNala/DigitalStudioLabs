This document outlines the design, structure, content, and technical specifications for the new Digital Studio Labs website. The primary goal is to create a premium, dynamic, and highly effective online presence that establishes the agency as expert professionals in custom web development, AI implementation, and related digital solutions. The website will serve as a key tool in converting prospects contacted via the Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy into paying clients by showcasing expertise, building immediate trust, and facilitating clear calls to action.

2. Project Goals

Establish Credibility & Expertise: Position Digital Studio Labs as a high-end, capable digital solutions provider.
Generate Qualified Leads: Convert website visitors (especially those targeted by outreach) into consultations or quote requests.
Showcase Capabilities: Effectively demonstrate the quality of work and breadth of services through a compelling portfolio and detailed service descriptions.
Build Trust Instantly: Utilize professional design, clear communication, testimonials, and transparent process information.
Reflect Brand Value: Create a "$100k website feel" that aligns with the premium nature of the services offered.
Support GTM Strategy: Provide a strong online foundation for direct outreach efforts and future marketing initiatives, including the Week 1 goal of rapid client acquisition.
3. Target Audience

Based on the GTM strategy, the website needs to resonate with:

Real Estate Professionals
B2B Service Providers
Vendor-Based Businesses (E-commerce potential)
New Businesses/Startups (including those needing MVPs)
Restaurants & Hospitality
The website copy and case studies should address the specific pain points and goals relevant to these segments.

4. Visual Style Guide

(This section incorporates the dynamic style requested)

4.1 Core Visual Philosophy:
The visual identity of Digital Studio Labs aims to be dynamic, sophisticated, and forward-thinking. We will utilize a refined color palette enhanced by subtle gradients and targeted glow effects to create a sense of depth, energy, and premium quality. The design should feel modern and engaging, immediately conveying innovation and expertise, while maintaining excellent readability and usability to drive conversions.

4.2 Base Color Palette:

Primary Background (--color-bg-primary): #0D1117 (Near Black/Deep Blue)
Secondary Background (--color-bg-secondary): #161B22
Primary Text (--color-text-primary): #E6EDF3 (Off-white)
Secondary Text / Captions (--color-text-secondary): #8B949E (Muted Gray)
Subtle Border / Separator (--color-border): #30363D
4.3 Gradient Definitions:
(Choose ONE Accent Gradient option and apply consistently)

Hero/Section Background Gradient (--gradient-bg-primary): radial-gradient(ellipse at top left, #161B22, #0D1117)
Accent Gradient (--gradient-accent):
Option 1 (Cool & Techy): linear-gradient(135deg, #00A0B0 0%, #4D4DFF 100%) (Teal to Electric Blue)
Option 2 (Warm & Energetic): linear-gradient(135deg, #FF6F00 0%, #FF8C42 100%) (Bright Orange to Coral)
Option 3 (Sophisticated & Rich): linear-gradient(135deg, #6A11CB 0%, #2575FC 100%) (Purple to Blue)
Hover/Active Gradient (--gradient-accent-hover): (Adjust based on chosen Accent Gradient)
Example for Option 1: linear-gradient(135deg, #00B4C4 0%, #5D5DFF 100%)
Usage: Accent gradients primarily for buttons, active states, key icons, and potentially subtle background flourishes. Background gradient for hero/large sections.
4.4 Glow Effect Definitions:
(Use sparingly and with intention)

Subtle Interactive Glow (--glow-interactive): Apply on hover/focus for primary CTAs and potentially interactive portfolio elements. Match color to Accent Gradient.
CSS Example (for Accent Option 1): box-shadow: 0 0 15px 3px rgba(0, 160, 176, 0.4); (Adjust color rgba based on chosen accent)
Ambient Accent Glow (--glow-ambient): Very subtle, large, soft glow behind 1-2 key visual elements per page at most. Match color to Accent Gradient, very low opacity.
CSS Example (for Accent Option 1): box-shadow: 0 5px 30px 10px rgba(77, 77, 255, 0.15); (Adjust color rgba, keep opacity ~0.1-0.2)
Text Glow: Avoid generally. Consider only for main H1 (text-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(230, 237, 243, 0.3);), test rigorously for readability.
4.5 Typography:

Heading Font: Poppins (Bold/Semi-Bold, Weights 700/600).
Body Font: Inter (Regular, Weight 400). Size: 17px, Line-height: 1.6.
Hierarchy: Strict adherence to H1, H2, H3... structure using size and weight. Ensure high contrast (use checkers).
4.6 Imagery & Iconography:

Use high-quality, professional photos (abstract tech, workspace, team - optional), custom graphics, and device mockups. Avoid generic stock.
Icons should be clean, modern, and consistent in style. Consider a premium icon set or custom icons matching the brand's sophistication. Potentially use the Accent Gradient or a subtle glow effect on relevant icons.
4.7 Layout & Interaction:

Clean, spacious layout using a standard grid system (e.g., 12-column). Asymmetric layouts acceptable where appropriate.
Subtle animations on scroll (fade-in, slight slide-up â€“ keep fast) and micro-interactions on buttons/links (hover effects defined above).
Ensure full responsiveness (Mobile-First).
